# FeedBack App

Create a list of Six multiple choice questions and their answers as ratings out of 5. The App accepts user input and accordingly outputs something on the last screen. At the end according to the total score calculated, show different colors on the screen as follows.  Score | Color of Text | Text Displayed  00 - 10 -> Red -> We are sorry for your inconvenience  11 - 20 -> Yellow -> Hope we serve you better next time  21 - 30 -> Green -> We hope you come back next time. The last screen must have a trigger to reset the app to the starting question. Use the Slider widget to accept the inputs.
